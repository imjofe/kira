## Test Structure

### Core Tests
- **`prompt_builder_test.dart`** - Comprehensive tests for the PromptBuilder utility (consolidated from multiple files)
- **`global_prompt_test.dart`** - Tests for the global system prompt (checksum and size constraints)
- **`slash_router_test.dart`** - Tests for slash command parsing and routing
- **`websocket_service_test.dart`** - Tests for WebSocket service functionality

### UI Tests
- **`chat/`** - Chat-related UI tests
  - `chat_provider_test.dart` - ChatProvider business logic tests
  - `chat_page_test.dart` - ChatPage widget interaction tests
- **`calendar_tests.dart`** - Calendar page widget tests
- **`goals_tests.dart`** - Goals page and provider tests
- **`schedule_tests.dart`** - Schedule page and task card tests

### Integration Tests
- **`provider_prompt_integration_test.dart`** - Integration tests between ChatProvider and PromptBuilder

### Unit Tests
- **`unit/schedule_provider_test.dart`** - Unit tests for ScheduleProvider

### Test Data
- **`goldens/`** - Golden test data for prompt builder tests
  - `minimal.json` - Minimal prompt test data
  - `mode_json.json` - JSON mode test data

## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Specific Test File
```bash
flutter test test/prompt_builder_test.dart
```

### With Verbose Output
```bash
flutter test --verbose
```

### Using Test Runner Script

## Test Organization

The tests are organized by:
1. **Core utilities** - PromptBuilder, SlashRouter, WebSocketService
2. **UI components** - Pages and widgets with their providers
3. **Integration** - Cross-component functionality
4. **Unit tests** - Isolated business logic

## Mocking Strategy

All tests use **Mocktail** for mocking dependencies. This provides a consistent and type-safe mocking experience across all test files.

## Dependencies

Test dependencies are defined in `pubspec.yaml`:
- `flutter_test` - Flutter testing framework
- `mocktail` - Mocking library
- `crypto` - For checksum tests
- `test` - General testing utilities

## Cleanup Summary

The test folder has been cleaned up by:
1. âœ… Removed duplicate `prompt_builder_golden_test..dart` file
2. âœ… Consolidated multiple prompt builder tests into a single comprehensive file
3. âœ… Fixed import paths in chat provider tests
4. âœ… Updated mocking library usage to be consistent (Mocktail)
5. âœ… Fixed string escaping issues
6. âœ… Added missing dependencies (crypto)
7. âœ… Fixed mock setup for WebSocket service tests

All tests now pass successfully! ðŸŽ‰
